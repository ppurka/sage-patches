Update: This repository is not updated anymore since Sage has migrated to
a git based system, from a mercurial based system.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains my patches to Sage that are still pending. Need
this for tracking the patches across multiple Sage installations, across
multiple machines.

This may also contain patches from other Sage tickets that I have currently
applied and which are not yet merged in Sage.

The master branch will always contain the pending patches. Other branches
may contain extra or old patches.

The no-hope directory contains patches which will probably never get into
Sage because of various reasons. If you want to know the reasons then just
visit the corresponding ticket page - the ticket number is part of the
patch name.
